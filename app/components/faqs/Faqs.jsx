    question: "Which CAT course is best for non-engineers to prepare for CAT 2025?",
    answer: `You can go for iQuanta flagship course CAT 2025 Full Course or the CAT 2025 Pro Batch. 
    These courses provide conceptual videos for non-engineers, for those who are extremely weak in quant. 
    After completion of each topic, there is a marathon that carries questions of CAT 2023. 
    We provide a topic-wise CAT mock test, 50 Questions on each Topic as Study Material, 
    and 10+ Sets of Hardcopy CAT Material as per the Updated Pattern (5000 Questions). 
    The Course has 250+ Recorded Videos and practice sessions after each class along with 24x7 instant doubt support.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Is it necessary to opt for any CAT coaching?",
    answer: `It depends on individual hard work and practice, but having a mentor beside you 
    can help you crack the exam easily. iQuanta is the best when it comes to content, study material, or doubt resolution.`,
  },
  {
    question: "When should I join a CAT course?",
    answer: `Ideally, you should start preparing at least 6-12 months before the exam. 
    Joining a structured CAT course early gives you ample time to practice and revise.`,
